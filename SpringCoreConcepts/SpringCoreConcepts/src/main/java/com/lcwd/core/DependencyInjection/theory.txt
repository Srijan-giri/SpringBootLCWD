There are three types of injection are : 1) Constructor Based Dependency Injection

                                         Ex : 
                                         class Student{
                                         
	                                         @Autowired
	                                         public Student(Animal animal){
	                                         
	                                         }
                                         
                                         }
                                         
                                         2) Setter Based Dependency Injection
                                         
                                         Ex:
                                         
                                         class Student{
                                         
                                             @Autowired
	                                         public void setAnimal(Animal animal)
	                                         {
	                                            this.animal =animal;
	                                         }
	               
                                         }      
                                         
                                         3) Field or Property-Based Dependency Injection

                                         Ex:
                                         
                                          class Student{
                                             
                                             @Autowired
                                             private Animal animal;
	               
                                         }
